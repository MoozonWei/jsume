JSON resume.

Inspired by [antfu/resume](https://github.com/antfu/resume) and [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/).

## How it works

- The data is hosted by [Gist](https://gist.github.com/MoozonWei/70c30e0182fdf013aa6454f10c9db299) with [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard.
- The website is hosted by [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) with CI/CD.

## Deploy your own resume

Clone with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

```shell
degit moozonwei/jsume my-resume
```
